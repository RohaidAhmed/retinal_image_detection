# image_picker1

A Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This application is a pre-release or the first stage in mobile application of our final year project "Smartphone-Based Detection of Retinal Abnormalities". It is the first step to disease detection and classification. It allows users to capture pictures at run time or select a previously captured image from the gallery. It passes the image to the tensorflow lite model that runs at the backend and tells the user if the image was a retinal image or a wild image along with how much confident the model is about the classification of the image.
